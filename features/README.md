# Feature files

This folder contains a number of feature files, written in Gherkin format, that are used to test that a given language generator faithfully implements the Open API specification.

Gherkin, used for Behaviour Driven Development, is a language-agnostic approach to defining system behaviour. Generators use the language-specific implementation (e.g. Cucumber.js) to implement and execute this suite of tests.
